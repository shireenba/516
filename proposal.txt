I have two ideas that I’m deciding between. For one of the ideas I would create a small corpus of research articles and write a program that finds parenthetical citations at the end of sentences. The purpose of this would be to speed up the identification of occurrences of such citations in the collected text. This would facilitate my analysis of such citations which I’m planning to do as part of another class. My other idea relates to the English Placement Test. After each test administration, I download the students’ essays from Canvas into a long Word document with each essay on a different page. Each essay is also labeled with a student code and the task number. What I need to do is save each essay as its own text file, and name that file with the student code and task number. Thus, my second idea is to write a program for this purpose.
